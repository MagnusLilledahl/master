# Computer Assisted Microscopy
I'm using a Leica SP8 microscope, which has a feature called Computer Assisted Microscopy or CAM in short. This is used when collecting images from samples in a matrix on a glass slide. Since the samples aren't completely aligned, software is used to adjust area of scanning.
